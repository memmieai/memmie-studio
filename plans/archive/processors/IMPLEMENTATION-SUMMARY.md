# ReYNa Studio Implementation Summary

## Architecture Updates Complete

This document summarizes all the architectural updates made to align ReYNa Studio with the new processor-centric, schema-driven design.

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Schema Service as Central Authority
- **New Service**: Schema Service (Port 8011) using PostgreSQL
- **Purpose**: Single source of truth for all data schemas
- **Features**: Versioning, validation, compatibility checking, bucket schemas
- **Location**: `/plans/06-schema-service-design.md`

### 2. Processor-Centric Architecture  
- **Renamed**: Provider Service → Processor Service
- **Purpose**: Register and orchestrate all data processors
- **Key Concept**: Processors transform blobs matching input schemas to output schemas
- **Explored Options**: 
  - Centralized storage (Plan 1)
  - Distributed storage (Plan 2)  
  - Hybrid storage (Plan 3)
- **Recommendation**: Hybrid-Lite approach for MVP
- **Location**: `/plans/processors/REC.md`

### 3. State Service as Blob Storage
- **Updated**: UserState now contains blob storage with dynamic buckets
- **Structure**: Flexible bucket hierarchy replacing fixed fields
- **Integration**: Schema validation on all blob creates/updates
- **Location**: `/plans/01-state-service-design.md` (updated)

### 4. Dynamic Bucket System
- **New System**: Replaces fixed fields (book_id, conversation_id) with flexible buckets
- **Purpose**: Universal organization system for any content type
- **Features**: Hierarchical structure, type-agnostic, metadata flexibility
- **Documentation**: `/plans/processors/buckets/`

### 5. Real-time WebSocket Support
- **New Design**: Comprehensive WebSocket implementation
- **Features**: Event filtering, user-specific routing, reconnection
- **Protocol**: Defined message types for client-server communication
- **Location**: `/plans/07-websocket-design.md`

2. `/plans/03-studio-api-design.md` - Updated with WebSocket support

## Key Design Patterns

### 1. Schema-First Development
Every piece of data has a schema:
```
Blob Creation → Schema Validation → Storage → Event Emission
```

### 2. Event-Driven Processing
```
User Action → Create Blob → NATS Event → Processor Subscription → Transform → New Blob
```

### 3. Real-time Updates
```
Backend Event → NATS → Studio API → WebSocket → Client UI Update
```

## Example Flow: Book Chapter Expansion

1. **User writes in Book Writer interface**
   - Client sends text via WebSocket
   - Studio API receives and validates

2. **Blob Creation**
   - Studio API → State Service
   - Validates against `text-input-v1` schema
   - Stores blob with metadata (book_id, chapter_num)
   - Emits `blob.created.text-input-v1` event

3. **Text Expansion Processing**
   - Text Expansion Processor subscribes to event
   - Fetches blob from State Service
   - Validates input schema
   - Expands text using GPT-4
   - Creates new blob with `expanded-text-v1` schema

4. **Real-time Update**
   - State Service emits `blob.derived` event
   - Studio API receives via NATS
   - Filters for user's WebSocket connections
   - Sends update to all user's devices
   - Client UI updates split view with expanded text

## MVP Deliverables

### Core Services
- ✅ Schema Service with validation
- ✅ State Service with blob storage
- ✅ Processor Service with registration
- ✅ Studio API with WebSocket

### Processors
- ✅ Text Expansion Processor
- ✅ Book Compiler Processor (design)
- ✅ Pitch Builder Processor (design)

### User Interfaces
- ✅ Book Writer (split-pane editor)
- ✅ Pitch Creator (structured sections)
- ✅ Dashboard (document management)

### Infrastructure
- ✅ NATS event streaming
- ✅ WebSocket real-time updates
- ✅ Schema validation throughout
- ✅ MongoDB for flexible storage

## Performance Targets

- Blob creation to UI update: <500ms
- WebSocket message delivery: <100ms  
- Schema validation: <50ms
- Text expansion: <3s for 1000 words
- Support 100 concurrent users

## Next Steps

### Immediate (MVP)
1. Implement Schema Service endpoints
2. Update State Service with blob collections
3. Build Text Expansion Processor
4. Deploy WebSocket infrastructure
5. Test with 100 beta users

### Post-MVP
1. Add more processors (grammar, style, research)
2. Implement external blob storage for large content
3. Add processor marketplace
4. Scale WebSocket with Redis pub/sub
5. Implement collaborative editing

## Migration Path

### From Current State
1. Keep existing UserState for settings
2. Add new Blob collection
3. Add Schema Service alongside
4. Gradually migrate features

### No Breaking Changes
- Existing auth continues to work
- Add new endpoints, don't remove old
- Graceful degradation for missing schemas

## Success Criteria

### Technical
- ✅ All blobs validate against schemas
- ✅ Events route correctly to processors
- ✅ WebSocket delivers updates <100ms
- ✅ System handles 100 concurrent users

### User Experience
- ✅ Text expands in real-time
- ✅ Multiple devices stay in sync
- ✅ No data loss on connection drops
- ✅ Intuitive book/pitch creation

## Conclusion

The ReYNa Studio architecture is now fully designed for a scalable, real-time, processor-driven system. The schema-first approach ensures data consistency, while the event-driven architecture enables loose coupling and independent scaling of processors.

The MVP implementation focuses on delivering core book writing and pitch creation features with real-time updates, setting a solid foundation for future expansion into music generation, research assistance, and collaborative features.

All plans are documented, examples are provided, and the system is ready for implementation.
